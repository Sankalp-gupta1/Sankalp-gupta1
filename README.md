## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a B.Tech student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**, passionate about combining AI with real-world applications. I build intelligent systems using **deep learning, full-stack tech, and large language models**.

- 🌱 Currently exploring LLMs, LangChain, and autonomous agents
- 🧩 Competitive Coder (DSA & ICPC)
- 🤝 Open to AI, ML, Web, and Cloud collabs
- 💡 Fun fact: I'm inspired by **M.S. Dhoni** — his calm strategy guides my debugging 😄
